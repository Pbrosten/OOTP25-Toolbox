# Ticket Index

Tracks planned/in-progress/completed work for OOTP25-Toolbox. Each ticket is a
markdown file in this directory named `NNNN-short-slug.md`, containing: the
problem it solves, design choices (including outstanding/undecided ones), the
chosen approach and files involved, a tag, and a status.

**Tags:** `feat` | `fix` | `chore` | `refactor`
**Statuses:** `Open` | `In-Progress` | `Closed`

New tickets should start from [TEMPLATE.md](TEMPLATE.md) and be added to the
table below (and any relevant epic section) once created.

## Epic: Admin DB operations as API endpoints

Motivated by repeated local friction running `flask --app app init-db` /
`update-db` from the host `.venv` (host can't resolve the `mariadb` container
hostname or see `/data/dumps`, requiring manual env-var overrides every time).
Exposing the same operations as backend routes runs them inside the container
with correct config by construction, and additionally allows triggering them
from a `curl` request or a future UI button.

Suggested order: 0001 → 0002 → 0003 → 0004 → 0005. 0006 split off from 0005's
design discussion (log-tail progress needs backend work 0004 didn't do).
